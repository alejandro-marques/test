About
*****

Crossdata is a distributed framework and a data layer that unifies the interaction with batch and
streaming sources supporting multiple datastore technologies thanks to its generic architecture and a custom SQL-like
language with support for streaming queries. Supporting multiple architectures imposes two main challenges: how to
normalize the access to the datastores, and how to cope with datastore limitations. To access multiple technologies
Crossdata defines a common unifying interface containing the set of operations that a datastore may support. New
connectors can be easily added to increase its connectivity capabilities. Two types of connectors are defined: native and spark-based.
Native connectors are faster for simple operations, while Spark-based connectors offer a larger set of functionality.
The Crossdata planner decides which connector will be used for any request based its characteristics. We offer a shell, Java/REST APIs,
JDBC and ODBC for BI.

Compiling Crossdata
===================

Compiling Crossdata involves generating a set of files (.tokens, Lexers and Parsers) from the different grammar
files. To automatically build Stratio Crossdata execute the following command::

    > mvn clean install

If you prefer to skip the unitary and integration tests, just type::

    > mvn clean install -DskipUTs -DskipITs


Running the com.stratio.crossdata-server
========================================
::

    > mvn exec:java -pl crossdata-server -Dexec.mainClass="com.stratio.crossdata.server.CrossdataApplication"

or you can run our script located in crossdata-dist::

    > chmod +x crossdata-dist/target/crossdata-dist-[crossdata-version]/bin/crossdata-server
    > cd crossdata-dist/target/crossdata-dist-[crossdata-version]/
    > bin/crossdata-server

or run it like a service::

    > bin/crossdata-server-daemon start
    


Running the crossdata-shell
===========================

The com.stratio.crossdata-shell allows users to launch interactive queries against a set of Crossdata servers. 
Works both in Unix and Windows.
The shell features:

-   History support (arrow navigation)
-   History search (ctrl-r)
-   Token completion (tab)
-   Help command
::

    > mvn exec:java -pl crossdata-shell -Dexec.mainClass="com.stratio.crossdata.sh.Shell"


The default behaviour of the Shell is asynchronous, however, the shell also supports synchronous query execution by
means of the --sync parameter.::

    > mvn exec:java -pl crossdata-shell -Dexec.mainClass="com.stratio.crossdata.sh.Shell" -Dexec.args="--sync"


Additionally, you can execute an script upon launching the shell. The script will be executed first,
and the prompt will be shown afterwards.::


    > mvn exec:java -pl crossdata-shell -Dexec.mainClass="com.stratio.crossdata.sh.Shell" -Dexec.args="--script /path/script.xdql"


You can run our shell too, executing our crossdata-dist script::

    > chmod +x crossdata-dist/target/crossdata-dist-[crossdata-version]/bin/crossdata-sh
    > cd crossdata-dist/target/crossdata-dist-[crossdata-version]/
    > bin/crossdata-sh



Useful commands
===============

Once the shell is running, you can exit the program introducing the word **exit** or **quit** in the query prompt. A command help system is available by introducing the command **help**. A help entry is available per command, to check specify help topics use **help command**.

Grammar
=======

Grammar specification for this release can be found `here <doc/src/site/sphinx/Grammar.rst>`_.


Getting started
===============
In this `link <GettingStarted.rst>`_ you can follow an example of Crossdata with a Cassandra Connector as an access
to a Cassandra datastore.


Crossdata in a distributed environment
======================================

In this `link <doc/src/site/sphinx/DistributedCrossdata.rst>`_ you can read how to configure crossdata in a
distributed environment.
